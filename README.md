Introduction
------------

While working on something cool in regards to gaming, I needed a way to make use of Lua, while I'm working mainly on C++, I wanted to quickly modify some information and call Lua methods. 

Main reason for this quick publishing is the upcoming Triton Gaming Event in Kosovo and my talk will be about my project so I wanted to publish this for the curious creatures.

For now I needed something simple, I'm still adding more methods as I'm working and I'll update this repository accordingly.
